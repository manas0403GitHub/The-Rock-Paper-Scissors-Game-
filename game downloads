📄 Paper: Flatten your hand✋. Paper beats rock. 

✂️ Scissors: Make a peace sign with your fingers✌️. Scissors beat paper. 

To play the game of rock-paper-scissors, players should stand a few steps away from each other and position their hands at their stomach level. The game follows a simple rule: rock breaks scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. To start the game, both players should count "rock, paper, scissors" by tapping their hands together. On the count of three, both players should reveal their choices by making rock, paper, or scissors with their hands. The game is designed to be simple and requires no technical expertise.

Have fun playing the game! 🎉

How to play the game:
  idea: the game is the rock, paper, scissors game but its more stuff
  Rock: Form a closed fist to represent rock. Rock beats scissors by crushing them.

  Paper: Lay your fingers flat and keep them together to play paper. Paper wraps around rock to lock it down, but it loses to scissors.

  Scissors: Make a peace sign with your index and middle finger to represent scissors. Scissors cut through paper but lose to rock.

  Remember this phrase: “Rock breaks scissors, scissors cut paper, paper covers rock.”
  
  When playing a round:
  
  Stand a few paces apart from your opponent.
  Face each other and hold your hands up at your stomach.
  Count “rock, paper, scissors” by tapping your hands together.
  On the count of three, both players reveal their choices by forming rock, paper, or scissors with their hands.
